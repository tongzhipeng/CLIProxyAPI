# AGENTS.md

Go 1.26+ proxy server providing OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Codex compatible APIs with OAuth and round-robin load balancing.

## Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI

## Commands
```bash
gofmt -w . # Format (required after Go changes)
go build -o cli-proxy-api ./cmd/server # Build
go run ./cmd/server # Run dev server
go test ./... # Run all tests
go test -v -run TestName ./path/to/pkg # Run single test
go build -o test-output ./cmd/server && rm test-output # Verify compile (REQUIRED after changes)

# Release Pipeline (Strict Deployment Gates)
./scripts/release.sh build   # Build candidate binary to bin/candidate/cliproxyapi with injected metadata
./scripts/release.sh verify  # Verify candidate on isolated port with real flags, auth controls & endpoints
./scripts/release.sh deploy  # Full deployment: build -> verify -> backup -> atomic replace -> restart -> healthcheck (auto-rollback on failure)
./scripts/release.sh rollback # Emergency manual rollback to previous backup
```
- Common flags: `--config <path>`, `--tui`, `--standalone`, `--local-model`, `--no-browser`, `--oauth-callback-port <port>`

## Release Gates & Deployment Discipline (Mandatory)
Unit tests passing does NOT prove the service can start and run under Homebrew/launchd configuration. All local service deployments MUST strictly execute via `./scripts/release.sh deploy`:
1. **Development & Runtime Isolation**: Builds must write to candidate directory (`bin/candidate/cliproxyapi`). Never directly overwrite the currently running production binary. Keep existing service running during test and build.
2. **Unified Entrypoint**: Version, commit SHA, build date, and default configuration path (`/opt/homebrew/etc/cliproxyapi.conf`) are centrally injected via ldflags. Development and release use the identical build recipe.
3. **Real Startup Verification**: Candidate binary must start on an isolated high port with a temporary data directory and real startup flags. Real configuration loading, HTTP endpoints (`GET /`), and positive/negative authentication controls (valid key 200, missing/invalid key 401) must pass before deployment. `--help` or `--version` is strictly prohibited as startup acceptance.
4. **Atomic Replacement & Automatic Rollback**: Upon verification, create a timestamped backup and `cliproxyapi.bak-latest`, atomically replace target via `mv -f`, and restart service via launchctl. If the process exits or fails post-restart health checks within the timeout, immediately and automatically restore the backup binary and restart.
5. **Independent Execution**: The release script runs locally and independently from start to finish. Because proxy clients depend on this service, replacement, healthcheck, and rollback must never rely on intermediate external agent commands to recover.


## Config
- Default config: `config.yaml` (template: `config.example.yaml`)
- `.env` is auto-loaded from the working directory
- Auth material defaults under `auths/`
- Storage backends: file-based default; optional Postgres/git/object store (`PGSTORE_*`, `GITSTORE_*`, `OBJECTSTORE_*`)

## Architecture
- `cmd/server/` — Server entrypoint
- `internal/api/` — Gin HTTP API (routes, middleware, modules)
- `internal/api/modules/amp/` — Amp integration (Amp-style routes + reverse proxy)
- `internal/thinking/` — Main thinking/reasoning pipeline. `ApplyThinking()` (apply.go) parses suffixes (`suffix.go`, suffix overrides body), normalizes config to canonical `ThinkingConfig` (`types.go`), normalizes and validates centrally (`validate.go`/`convert.go`), then applies provider-specific output via `ProviderApplier`. Do not break this "canonical representation → per-provider translation" architecture.
- `internal/runtime/executor/` — Per-provider runtime executors (incl. Codex WebSocket)
- `internal/translator/` — Provider protocol translators (and shared `common`)
- `internal/registry/` — Model registry + remote updater (`StartModelsUpdater`); `--local-model` disables remote updates
- `internal/store/` — Storage implementations and secret resolution
- `internal/managementasset/` — Config snapshots and management assets
- `internal/cache/` — Request signature caching
- `internal/watcher/` — Config hot-reload and watchers
- `internal/wsrelay/` — WebSocket relay sessions
- `internal/usage/` — Usage and token accounting
- `internal/home/` — CLIProxyAPIHome control plane integration (bootstrap, RESP communication, dispatch coordination)
- `internal/tui/` — Bubbletea terminal UI (`--tui`, `--standalone`)
- `sdk/cliproxy/` — Embeddable SDK entry (service/builder/watchers/pipeline)
- `test/` — Cross-module integration tests

## Code Conventions
- Keep changes small and simple (KISS)
- Comments in English only
- If editing code that already contains non-English comments, translate them to English (don’t add new non-English comments)
- For user-visible strings, keep the existing language used in that file/area
- New Markdown docs should be in English unless the file is explicitly language-specific (e.g. `README_CN.md`)
- As a rule, do not make standalone changes to `internal/translator/`. You may modify it only as part of broader changes elsewhere.
- If a task requires changing only `internal/translator/`, run `gh repo view --json viewerPermission -q .viewerPermission` to confirm you have `WRITE`, `MAINTAIN`, or `ADMIN`. If you do, you may proceed; otherwise, file a GitHub issue including the goal, rationale, and the intended implementation code, then stop further work.
- `internal/runtime/executor/` should contain executors and their unit tests only. Place any helper/supporting files under `internal/runtime/executor/helps/`.
- Follow `gofmt`; keep imports goimports-style; wrap errors with context where helpful
- Do not use `log.Fatal`/`log.Fatalf` (terminates the process); prefer returning errors and logging via logrus
- Shadowed variables: use method suffix (`errStart := server.Start()`)
- Wrap defer errors: `defer func() { if err := f.Close(); err != nil { log.Errorf(...) } }()`
- Use logrus structured logging; avoid leaking secrets/tokens in logs
- Avoid panics in HTTP handlers; prefer logged errors and meaningful HTTP status codes
- Timeouts are allowed only during credential acquisition; after an upstream connection is established, do not set timeouts for any subsequent network behavior. Intentional exceptions that must remain allowed are the Codex websocket liveness deadlines in `internal/runtime/executor/codex_websockets_executor.go`, the wsrelay session deadlines in `internal/wsrelay/session.go`, the management APICall timeout in `internal/api/handlers/management/api_tools.go`, and the `cmd/fetch_antigravity_models` utility timeouts
- Avoid wall-clock `time.Sleep` in TTL, expiration, ordering, or cache-eviction unit tests due to platform timer granularity (e.g. Windows default timer resolution of ~15.6ms) and CI jitter under load; prefer controllable clocks (`nowFunc` / mock clock), explicit timestamp manipulation, or deterministic synchronization primitives.
- Note: if modifying features that involve CLIProxyAPIHome, check if corresponding updates are needed in the CLIProxyAPIHome repository.
